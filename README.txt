This project is aimed at gaining a very basic understanding of how Docker works.
We are in charge of building two microservices (a server and a client) and 
automating/deploying them.

This project is laid out as follows:

Main_Directory

  docker-compose.yml
  Questions.txt

  client
    Dockerfile
    requirements.txt
    app
      client.py
  server
    Dockerfile
    requirements.txt
    app
      server.py
